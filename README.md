# 👋 Hi, Nice to see you! :woman_technologist:

**Ironchip-Developer** has a ✨ _main function_ :✨
Better manage bugs.

Log bugs quickly with details such as severity and due date, and assign them to the right developers. Get a consolidated list of all bugs and track team progress with emails, reports and milestones.

Other responsibilities include benchmarking against standards, process monitoring, all aimed at preventing errors during the product development process.
Following best practices early on is the way to go and I'm a huge supporter of it.

We will follow up on the reported bugs and try to give a prompt resolution, always allowing the user to be informed of the status of the problem at all times.

## We stimulate conversation.

We make it easy to collaborate on our project by starting a discussion or sharing an idea with a complete set of collaboration tools such as interactive forums and news feeds.
